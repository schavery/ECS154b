you'll love this one. We made a tasty python script to generate our ROM values
cuz we didn't really optimize the rom at all

so it uses 16 bits of address for 24 bits of control signals
I think the data width is pretty set in stone but we could probably cut the
number of addresses WAY way down.

anyway we'll start testing now
with love,
us
