Notes:
We strived for maximum ugliness. When we could have used tunnels, we used wires, and by the end of the project we really regretted it.
Maybe not totally regretted, every time we showed someone our circuit they would get this look of disgust on their face and that was pretty satisfying.

Anyway, we gave up. The final test circuit only kind of works; compliance ceases during the third branch instruction (not taken) because we need to stall for the value to come back from memory, but our stall logic is no good, so we disabled it and just want the rest of that tasty partial credit.

Everything in noforwarding and forwarding should be good.

Thanks!
